# Matkap Web

Hunt down malicious Telegram bots used as malware command-and-control (C2).

Matkap is the web version of [0x6rss/matkap](https://github.com/0x6rss/matkap).
A lot of commodity malware (stealers, RATs) exfiltrates stolen data to a
Telegram **bot** and reads it from a private chat. If you recover that bot's
token, Matkap lets you validate it, recover the operator's data, monitor the
bot live, and discover more leaked tokens from threat-intel sources.

This is a defensive Telegram threat-hunting tool, not a malware-analysis
engine. Use it only on projects and tokens you are authorized to investigate.

## Features

- **Hunt** — with a bot token (and the operator's chat id) forward the operator's
  messages/files into your own chat via `forwardMessage`.
- **IOC Discovery** — find leaked bot tokens across ThreatFox / urlscan / ZoomEye;
  optionally validate them (`getMe`) and resolve chat ids (`getUpdates`).
- **Monitor** — hijack a live bot's incoming update stream (10 min / 1 h / 12 h)
  to capture new exfil messages + chat ids in real time.
- **Threat Feeds** — TweetFeed (Twitter/X) and TI-report dorking of vendor blogs.
- **MalwareBazaar** — automatically track the last 14 days of samples matching
  the `telegram_bot_api` YARA rule, plus manually check report hashes.
- **JADX MCP connector** — inspect the Android project already open in JADX
  through local, read-only tools. Ghidra and Binary Ninja support is coming soon.
- **Multi-model AI investigation** — use OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Grok, Kimi, or
  DeepSeek; only exact, format-validated Telegram credentials enter the findings view.
- **Threat statistics** — use the sidebar tab directly below MCP Lab to combine
  MalwareBazaar YARA metadata, TweetFeed, and dated TI reports into 7/14/30-day
  type, family, filename, campaign, source, and daily-activity charts.
- Feeds auto-refresh every 10 minutes and are cached in the database.

## Interface

The screenshots below show MATKAP's main workspaces. Any indicators or expired
credentials visible in these examples are historical test data; `.env` values,
provider API keys, Telegram string sessions, and personal account details are
not included.

### Hunt workspace

statistics assembled from cached MATKAP data sources.

## How the hunt works

1. You provide a **bot token** (recovered from a malware sample or IOC Discovery).
2. Matkap validates it (`getMe`) and, using a Telegram **user account** you
   control, sends `/start` to the bot to trigger an update.
3. `getUpdates` reveals the operator's chat id and the latest message id.
4. Using the bot token's `forwardMessage` privilege, Matkap forwards the
   operator's messages into your own chat, capturing text and files.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- PostgreSQL is optional. Without `DATABASE_URL`, MCP findings run in memory.
- Docker Desktop is needed only when using the included PostgreSQL container or
  running the complete Docker Compose stack.
- A Telegram **user account** (not a bot) to act as the controller, plus its
  `api_id` / `api_hash` from https://my.telegram.org

## Quick start on Windows

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/0x6rss/matkap.git
cd matkap
npm install
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

On Linux or macOS, use `cp .env.example .env` instead of `Copy-Item`.

### 1. Database (optional)

A ready-to-use PostgreSQL database is provided through Docker. Skip this entire
step if persistence is not needed; MATKAP will still run, but captured logs and
feed caches will exist only in memory and are lost when the server stops.

To start only PostgreSQL on local port 5433:

```powershell
docker compose up -d db
```

Then set in `.env`:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://matkap:matkap@localhost:5433/matkap
```

The database is reachable only from this computer. Any other reachable
PostgreSQL instance can be used; MATKAP creates its required tables on start.

### 2. Telegram API credentials

Log in at https://my.telegram.org -> API development tools, and copy your
`api_id` and `api_hash` into `.env`:

```
TELEGRAM_API_ID=123456
TELEGRAM_API_HASH=your_api_hash
TELEGRAM_PHONE=+1555...
```

### 3. Log in to Telegram (one time)

Leave `TELEGRAM_STRING_SESSION` empty and start the app in a local terminal
with `NODE_ENV=development` (the provided default). MATKAP asks for the login
code sent by Telegram and, if enabled on the account, the 2FA password:

```bash
npm start
# Enter the Telegram login code: 12345
# Enter Telegram 2FA password (if requested)
# [default] Login OK. String session saved to .env for future starts.
```

MATKAP writes the generated `TELEGRAM_STRING_SESSION` directly to `.env`
without printing it. Later `npm start` runs reuse that session and do not ask
for a code. If Telegram invalidates the saved session, development mode asks
you to log in again and replaces it automatically. Keep `.env` private and
never commit or share it.

### 4. Single account vs. multiple accounts

**Single account** — just fill the fields above.

**Multiple accounts** — set `TELEGRAM_ACCOUNTS` to a JSON array (this overrides
the single-account fields). On first login, include `phone` and leave
`stringSession` empty for each account. MATKAP saves each generated session back
into the JSON value in `.env`. The UI shows an account selector; the server
round-robins if you do not pick one:

```
TELEGRAM_ACCOUNTS=[{"label":"acc1","apiId":"111","apiHash":"aaa","phone":"+15550000001","stringSession":""},{"label":"acc2","apiId":"222","apiHash":"bbb","phone":"+15550000002","stringSession":""}]
```

## Run

```powershell
npm start
# open http://localhost:3000
```

For the complete Docker stack, first complete the one-time Telegram login above
with `npm start`, then stop it with `Ctrl+C`. The generated session is now in
`.env`, so the container will not need an interactive login. Start the app and
database with:

```powershell
docker compose up --build
```

Open http://localhost:3000. Both the web application and PostgreSQL published
ports are restricted to `127.0.0.1` by the provided Compose configuration.

## JADX connector

The current release supports **JADX only**. Ghidra and Binary Ninja connectors
are shown as **SOON** and will be added later. MATKAP does not execute or upload
the APK; it reads the project already open in JADX through a local connector.

### End-user installation on Windows

1. Download `MATKAP-JADX-Connector-6.4.1.zip` from GitHub Releases or from
   [`connectors/jadx/dist`](connectors/jadx/dist/MATKAP-JADX-Connector-6.4.1.zip)
   in the cloned repository.
2. Extract the ZIP and close JADX if it is open.
3. Open PowerShell in the extracted folder and run:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1
```

4. Reopen JADX and load the APK.
5. In MATKAP, open **MCP Lab**, click **Connect JADX**, then click
   **Scan open JADX project**.

That is the entire connector setup. End users do not compile anything and do
not install Maven, Python, Node.js, or a separate MCP bridge for the connector.
The ZIP contains the ready JAR, installer, SHA-256 checksum, license, and notice.

When running directly from this repository, the same installer is available at:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\connectors\jadx\install.ps1
```

MATKAP's default connector configuration is:

```env
JADX_MCP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8650
JADX_MCP_TRANSPORT=jadx-rest
```

The installer verifies the packaged JAR's SHA-256 and backs up an existing
`jadx-ai-mcp.jar` before replacing it. The endpoint listens only on the local
machine. APK resources are size-limited, treated as data, and never executed.
MATKAP first scans likely text resources locally; enable **Use AI fallback after
local scan** only when deeper source analysis is wanted.

### AI provider

Add at least one provider key to `.env` (choose whichever provider you use):

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
GEMINI_API_KEY=
XAI_API_KEY=
KIMI_API_KEY=
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=
```

An AI key is optional for the local deterministic MCP preflight. It is used only
when **Use AI fallback after local scan** is explicitly enabled and the preflight
cannot recover an exact token and chat ID.

The bundled adapters use each provider's REST API. Every default model and
endpoint can be overridden with `<PROVIDER>_MODEL` and `<PROVIDER>_BASE_URL`;
see `.env.example` for the complete list. Choose one configured provider in
**MCP Lab**, enable the AI fallback checkbox, and click **Scan open JADX project**.

Provider output is treated as untrusted: candidates must match MATKAP's exact
Telegram token/chat-id formats before storage. Dashboard bot tokens stay masked
until the local user clicks **Reveal**.

For a lightweight MCP-only launch, set:

```env
MATKAP_DISABLE_DATABASE=true
MATKAP_DISABLE_TELEGRAM=true
MATKAP_DISABLE_FEEDS=true
```

Run the MCP and mocked provider-adapter tests with `npm test`.

## Dashboard

The UI is organised into tabs:

- **Hunt** — the control panel + operation logs + captured messages.
- **IOC Discovery** — find leaked tokens (see below).
- **Threat Feeds** — TweetFeed + TI Report Dorking.
- **MalwareBazaar** — check report hashes on abuse.ch.

### Hunt

1. (If multiple accounts) pick a controller account.
2. Paste the **bot token** and your own **chat id** (message
   [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) to get it).
3. **Start** validates + connects, **Forward All** captures the operator's
   messages, **Stop**/**Resume** control long runs, **Export** downloads the
   captured messages as JSON.

## IOC discovery (find leaked bot tokens)

The **IOC Discovery** panel searches threat-intel sources for Telegram bot
credentials and parses out bot tokens + chat ids. **Use** auto-fills the hunt.

| Source | Env key | Default query | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| ThreatFox | `ABUSECH_AUTH_KEY` | `api.telegram.org` | abuse.ch IOC DB; values are often full `bot<token>` URLs; malware family attached. Best free source. Also `tag:telegram-c2` / `malware:...` |
| urlscan | `URLSCAN_KEY` | `domain:api.telegram.org` | Free tier; pulls each scan's request URLs + DOM (capped at 50) |
| ZoomEye | `ZOOMEYE_KEY` | `http.body="api.telegram.org"` | `body` needs a Business plan; free tier works with "Fetch pages directly" |

Options in the panel:

- **Fetch pages directly** — for sources that only return a `link` on the free
  tier (ZoomEye), the server fetches each discovered link and parses it locally.
  Trade-off: your server connects to those (often malicious) hosts, revealing its
  IP. Off by default.
- **Resolve chat_id & validate** — queries each bot (`getMe` + deletes any
  webhook + `getUpdates`) to mark it **live @username** / **dead** and fill the
  chat id when a pending update exists (works for idle bots; active bots consume
  their own updates).
- **Monitor** (on live tokens) — starts a live monitor for the selected duration
  (10 min / 1 h / 12 h). Captured messages appear in the **Hunt** tab and persist
  to the DB. Stop early with the Hunt **Stop** button.

Adding a source is one file: create `sources/<name>.js` exporting
`search({ key, query, size })` that returns `[{host, ip, port, link, title, date, body}]`,
then register it in `sources/index.js`. The token/chat-id parser (`ioc.js`) is
shared across all sources.

## Threat feeds

Both feeds are refreshed every 10 minutes and cached in the DB; the panels load
the cache instantly and show "updated X ago".

- **TweetFeed** — community IOCs from Twitter/X ([tweetfeed.live](https://tweetfeed.live)),
  no key. The server groups IOCs by tweet, fetches each tweet's text via X's
  public syndication endpoint, and lists tweets mentioning a Telegram bot.
- **TI Report Dorking** — no key. Generates `site:<source> "telegram bot"`-style
  dorks across reputable TI publishers and scores each article on Telegram-bot
  signals; only hits at/above the min score are shown. Uses DuckDuckGo by
  default (which rate-limits scraping); set `GOOGLE_CSE_KEY` + `GOOGLE_CSE_CX`
  (free Google Programmable Search, 100/day) for reliable results.

## MalwareBazaar

The **MalwareBazaar** tab automatically queries the `telegram_bot_api` YARA rule,
keeps samples first seen during the last 14 days, and displays their SHA-256,
other hashes, family, file metadata, tags, detections, reporter, and abuse.ch
sample page. Metadata refreshes on server startup and every 3 hours; MATKAP does
not download malware files. This feed uses the YARA rule only and does not merge
the broader `Telegram` tag results.

The manual hash checker remains available below the feed. Run a TI Report
Dorking hunt, click **Load from reports**, then **Check MalwareBazaar** to query
those hashes individually. Both features require a free abuse.ch **Auth-Key**
(`ABUSECH_AUTH_KEY`).

## Threat statistics

Open the standalone **Threat Statistics** sidebar tab directly below **MCP Lab**.
Select 7, 14, or 30 days to combine the cached `telegram_bot_api`
MalwareBazaar results, TweetFeed signals, and dated TI reports. It includes a
malware-type pie chart, a three-source daily activity chart, and ranked charts
for filenames, malware families, explicit campaign metadata, and report
publishers.

Statistics use only fields present in the source data. Reports without a
publication date are counted in coverage but excluded from time-window charts;
campaign names are shown only when the upstream metadata explicitly identifies
them. MATKAP does not infer a campaign from a report title or arbitrary tag.

## Notes

- No login and no rate limits: this is a self-hosted, open tool. Each browser
  session gets its own isolated workspace; captured data persists to the DB.
- Anyone with the URL can use the instance. Do not expose it publicly without
  putting your own access control (reverse proxy / auth) in front of it.
- Monitor and "resolve" query live bots and delete their webhooks — an active,
  intrusive step against the C2. Use only within an authorized investigation.
